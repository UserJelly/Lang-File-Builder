# Lang File Builder
For Flan's mod content pack items Name and NameSpaceID auto build process

This program requires your permission to run smoothly.
In addition, if you need to create block-type items such as weapon boxes, equipment boxes, etc.,
you need to run this program directly. Also, find a text editor you like
and replace all instances of "item" with "tile".
